House Prices Prediction

Overview
House prices prediction is a crucial task that helps real estate agents, buyers, and sellers understand the housing market. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on historical data.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of 8,000 rows and 12 columns, including features such as house size, location, and number of bedrooms.

Methodology
1. Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. Feature engineering: Creating new features that capture relevant information.
3. Model selection: Comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
4. Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing model parameters using cross-validation and grid search.
